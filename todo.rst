Is the same delete algorithm for binary search trees used in both the 2nd Ed. of CLRS as in the 3rd Edition? The pseudo code for delete does differs betwen the 2nd and 3rd editions. However, is what the same basic approach of replacing an internal node with its in-order successor used in both the 2nd edition and 3rd?

The CLRS 2nd edition's delete pseudo code is in `Chapter 13 of CLRS, 2nd Edtion of CLRS <http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~csli/graduate/algorithms/book6/chap13.htm>`_ 
The 3rd editions's delete pseudo code is in `Chapter 12 <http://ressources.unisciel.fr/algoprog/s00aaroot/aa00module1/res/%5BCormen-AL2011%5DIntroduction_To_Algorithms-A3.pdf.
